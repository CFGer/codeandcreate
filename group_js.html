                        The idea of this project is to enable you to think like a programmer - being able to break problems down is the most important part of learning to code. Once you can successfully break a problem down into managable chunks you can start to solve it!

                        The above extract of HTML creates an input form that accepts text. With this new knowledge you should be able to create a simple HTML page with all the elements that we need.

                    We'll need to know a little bit more about JavaScript and programming in general before we can crack on with the rest of Tough Love. In particular, we'll need to know what variables and arrays are. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Much like algebra, variables are containers for storing information.
                   </p>
<pre>
var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var x = x + y;
var sum = 10020;
var company = "Code First: Girls";
</pre>
                <p>
                    var is a keyword in JavaScript that means I want to <em>declare</em>a variable.
                </p>

                   <h2 id="arrays">JavaScript Arrays</h2>
                   <p>
                    JavaScript arrays are similar to variables, but they allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. You can consider arrays to be lists, in fact in some programming languages they are called exactly that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Each of these values is an element of our array and is associated with a number, called an index. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    These <em>lists</em> can be particularily useful when we need to represent a list of data that we may need to pick a random element from, or do some operation on each element.
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        To create an array we use square brackets, and comma seperated lists. For example:
                    </p>
<pre>
    var myArray = ['First element', 'Second element', Third element];
</pre>
                    <p>
                        This creates an array called myArray with three string elements in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before arrays can be of much use to us, we need to know how to get elements back out of them. Every element in the array has an index associated with it. The first element in the array is associated with the 0 index, the second element in the array the 1 index etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a bit weird, but nearly all numbering in computer science starts with zero! 
                    </p>
<pre>
var myArray = ['First element', 'Second element', 'Third element', 'Fourth element', 'Fifth element'];
myArray[0];
myArray[1];
myArray[3];
</pre>
                    <p>
                        The above code shows us how to get our elements out of arrays. We use the syntax <code>arrayName[index];</code>
                    </p>

                    <tasks>
                        <item title="Open the Console in Chrome"></item>
                        <item title="Create an array of strings"> Have at least 4 elements in the array. Use the syntax above to help out</item>
                        <item title="Practice getting elements back out of the array"> Remember, the first element has index 0!</item>

                    </tasks>
                    <p>
                        We can do more than just insert and get things out of arrays! There are a couple of really useful methods that you can use with arrays that we will explore now. 
                    </p>
<pre>
var names = ["Nick", "Mark", "Maddie", "Alice", "Alan"];
var lengthOfNames = names.length;
</pre>
                    <p>
                        <code>arrayName.length</code> will tell you how many element are in your array. This can be really handy when you need to loop over everything in your array (which we'll do soon!).
                    </p>
<pre>
var names = ["Nick", "Mark", "Maddie", "Alice", "Alan"];
names.indexOf("Nick");
names.indexOf("Alice");
names.indexOf("Patrick");
</pre>             
                    <p>
                        <code>arrayName.indexOf("Something")</code> will tell us which index "Something" is at in our array, if it exists at all. If the element we are searching for doesn't exist we will be given back -1. 
                    </p>
                    <tasks>
                        <item title="In Chromes developer tools"></item>

                    </tasks>
                    <h3 id="random">Selecting a Random element from an array</h3>
<pre>
var names = ['Nick', 'Alan', 'Trevor', 'Lucy'];
var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * names.length);
var randomElement = names[randomIndex];
</pre>
                    <p>
                        Okay - how does this work? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>Math.random()</code> generates a random number between 0 and 1 (but never actually 1, maybe 0.999999).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then multiply that number by the length of our array. In this case our length is 4, so multiplying a random number between 0 and 1 by 4 will give us a number between 0 and 4 (but again never quite 4, maybe 3.99999).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then use Math.floor() which takes a number and rounds it down to the nearest integer. So 3.9999 becomes 3. 2.1 becomes 2. We store this as randomIndex
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then use our normal way of accessing array elements to access our random index element!
                    </p>

                <h3>Adding a question mark to the end of the input message</h3>
                <p>
                    If you study the original Tough Love website you'll notice Jennifer <em>appends</em> a question mark to the end of the message that the user types. We can do this too!
                </p>
<pre>
var inputMessage = $('input').val();
inputMessage = inputMessage + "?";
</pre>
                <p>
                    What this does is it gets the value of the text that is currently in the input box, and saves it in a variable called inputMessage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then do something called <em>string concatenation</em> to add two strings together. We do this with the + operator, which can be used on strings as well as maths!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>inputMessage + "?"</code> adds a question mark character to the end of the input string. We then overwrite the value of out old inputMessage and set the new one equal to this string (with the appended ?)
                </p>
                <tasks>
                    <item title="Add the code to append a ?"> The code is above and should be placed on the line below $('input').val()</item>
                </tasks>
                <h3>What if the input box is empty?</h3>
                <p>
                    On Jeniffer's site, if you leave the input box blank and hit submit you get the default "You don't fill in forms?" remark. We should have this on our site.
                </p>
<pre>
var inputMessage = $('input').val();
if(inputMessage == '') {
    inputMessage = 'You don't fill in forms';
}
inputMessage = inputMessage + "?";
</pre>
                <tasks>
                    <item title="Study the above code. Can you work out what it does?"> If you read it out, it sounds like english!</item>
                </tasks>
                <p>
                    This code uses what's called a <em>conditional statement</em> with an if statement. This checkes the if the <em>condition</em> is true, and if it is executes the code between the curly braces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, the code checks to see if the inputMessage (the input from the box) is empty <code>== ''</code>. The empty check tests to see if the string in the inputBox is equal to an empty string. If is is, the inputMessage is set to the default You don't fill in forms message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One important gotcha is the <code>==</code>. The double equals. This tests for equality. We've seen the <code>=</code> single equals before, this is used to assign something to a variable. Programmers of all experiance get caught out by this at times, don't be one of them.
