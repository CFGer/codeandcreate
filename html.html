                        In this session we will take our first step towards creating Ben's website. Together, by the end of the session we will have created <a href="/exercises/first.html">this.</a>

                    <p>
                        Although it may not look like much, getting the bare bones of the site created quickly will speed up development down the road.

                    <h2 id="what">What is HTML?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every website on the Internet is just a set of files that your browser (Chrome in this case) knows how to display. These three file types are:
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-4">
                            <div class="thumbnail">
                              <img src="images/html5.png" alt="...">
                              <div class="caption">
                                <h3>HTML</h3>
                                <p>Used for displaying the content and structure of your site</p>
                              </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4">
                            <div class="thumbnail">

                              <img src="images/css3.jpeg" alt="...">
                              <div class="caption">

                                <p>Used for the design of your site, what it looks like.</p>

                              <div class="caption">
                                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                                <p>Used for the behaviour of your site, what it does.</p>
                              </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                    <p>
                        All of these technologies are said to be <em>client side technologies</em>, this means that HTML, CSS and JavaScript runs on your computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you visit a website what you are actually doing is requesting the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files from a <em>web server</em> that <em>hosts</em> that sites files. Your browser then reads these files and displays them to you as a web page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This has an interesting side effect that we will discover now.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="dev">Developer Tools</h2>
                    <p>
                        Because the HTML, CSS and JavaScript are sent you your browser, it is easy for you to look at them. There are no secrets in HTML, CSS or JS. If there's a part of a webpage that you like, it's easy to find out how it is coded and use the technique yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every browser provides a way for you to look at the <em>source</em> of the site your are currently browsing, and Chrome's is especially good. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Google Chrome comes with a powerful set of developer tools built in that allow you to interactively inspect the source code of a site that you visit. To open developer tools use <code>View > Developer > Developer Tools</code> 
                    </p>
                        <tasks>
                            <item title="Browse to your favourite website"></item>
                            <item title="Open Developer Tools"><code>View > Developer > Developer Tools</code></item>
                            <item title="Select Elements tab"></item>
                            <item title="Select the magnifying glass"> Should be on the left hand side of the developer tools<img src="images/magnify.jpg"></item>

                            <item title="Try changing some HTML"> Double clicking on the HTML in developer tools should allow you to change it.</item>
                            <item title="Try chaging some CSS"> CSS is located in the top box on the right</item>
                            <item title="Refresh the page"> Note that the changes disappear</item>
                        </tasks>
                    <h2 id="folder">A website in a folder</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the great things about HTML is that you don't need a lot to see it working on your laptop, all you need is a text editor and a web browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To get up and running you need to understand that a website is just a collection of files that all live inside one folder. This folder effectivly becomes your website. When we want to put our website on the Internet, all we need to do is move this folder to a <em>web server</em> somewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anything that you want to appear on your website must be within this folder. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images &amp; Downloadable Content, it all must go inside this folder
                    </p>
                    <tasks>
                        <item title="Create a new folder on your laptop"> It doesn't matter where it is or what you call it, as long as you remember this. Don't give it a name with spaces in though, use underscores instead.</item>
                    </tasks>
                    <h2 id="usingSublime">Using Sublime Text</h2>
                    <tasks>
                        <item title="Open Sublime Text 2"></item>
                    </tasks>
                    <p>
                        All HTML that we will ever write needs to be written in a text editor. Remember from the prep work that we use Sublime as it doesn't save any extra nasty characters like Word does and it gives us Syntax highlighting, this will make more sense later!
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="firstHTML">Our first look at real HTML</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ok - let's write our first bit of HTML, remember the site we are trying to create in this session is <a href="/exercises/first.html">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's take our first step towards that by creating a heading element on our site.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/CodeFirstGirls/9619277.js"></script>
                    <tasks>
                        <item title="Copy the above <h1> code into a new file in Sublime"></item>
                        <item title="Save the file as index.html"></item>
                        <item title="Use Chrome to open this file"><code>File > Open File </code> Then navigate to the folder and file you just created</item>
                    </tasks>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="controllers.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="directives.js"></script>
