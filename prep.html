                    <p>This short 2 day introductory course will introduce you to the basics of web programming. You will develop your understanding of how the internet works, learn to code a basic site using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript, and learn how to manage your code and get your site online using a tool called git.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the weekend you will all have built <a href="final.html">this website</a> <img class="inpara" src="images/ben.jpg">, an e-commerce store for our Ugandan coffee bean farmer, Ben.  There will also be time at the end for you to customize your site if you're not a Coffee drinker yourself, and you'd rather have a different site to show off.</p>
                    <p>Ben needs to make more money, and he hears that if he sells his coffee direct to consumers in Edinburgh his profit margins will sky rocket. Our job is to help make this happen. </p>
                    <p>
                        Ben has purchased a van and is willing to deliver coffee all over Edinburgh, he just needs a website to accept orders online. He'll need the website to allow people to place orders and tell them how long it'll take Ben to reach them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interspersed within the notes you will find these blue exercise boxes, check things off as you complete them and come back later to start where you left off.</p>

                    <h3 id="sublime">Sublime Text (2)</h3>
                    <div class="inset">
                        <p>
                            <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text</a> is a text editor - a program that can be used for writing code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you write code it is important that the editor stores just the text you wrote, so that it can be properly interpreted when you run it. Word processors, like MS Word, add a lot of extra information to the text you write - layout, font styles, etc. - so can't be used for this purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You probably already have a text editor, such as notepad or textedit, on your laptop that could be used for writing code. Sublime Text is better because it also does syntax highlighting - it will colour your code, making it easier to see what's going on.
                        </p>

                            Chrome is a free web browser provided by Google. There are several other web browsers that you might have used, including Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox and Opera. We will be using Chrome as it comes with a good set of developer tools that we will be using over the course.

                           SourceTree is a free Git client that makes using Git easier, a program traditionally used from the command line. SourceTree allows us to avoid having to remember cumbersome commands by providing a graphical user interface that we can interact with.
                        </p>
                        <p>We'll cover what Git is later today, but for now know that it's a tool that software developers use to track changes in their code, collaborate and backup their work. We'll also use Git to publish our site onto the Internet.</p>
